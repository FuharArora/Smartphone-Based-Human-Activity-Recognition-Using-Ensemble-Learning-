# Smartphone-Based-Human-Activity-Recognition-Using-Ensemble-Learning-
 Using the smartphone built-in sensors (Accelerometer &amp; Gyroscope), we  identify six different human physical activities such as sitting, standing, laying, walking, moving upstairs and moving downstairs. To do this we use a public standard UCI HAR dataset. In this project we  propose our own  ensemble machine learning algorithm to recognize six different physical activities and show the performance of the proposed model in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F-Measure.
